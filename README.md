# HTML and CSS Examples

This repository contains several examples demonstrating how to accomplish common UI tasks using just HTML and CSS, with minimal to no JavaScript. Each example is self-contained in its own folder, and includes an `index.html` and `styles.css` file for easy experimentation.

## Folder Structure

The project is organized into the following folders, each containing a specific example:

- **accordions**: Example of creating an accordion interface with only HTML and CSS.
- **auto-suggest**: An auto-suggest input field implemented using the HTML `<datalist>` element.
- **custom-switches**: A custom toggle switch (checkbox) built with HTML and CSS, no JavaScript required.
- **scroll-animations**: Scroll-triggered animations with CSS, using `scroll-behavior` and other modern CSS features.
- **smooth-scrolling**: Implementing smooth scrolling between sections of the page using just CSS.

Each folder contains:
- `index.html`: The HTML file for the example.
- `styles.css`: The CSS file used to style the example.

## How to Run the Project

To view and interact with the examples, follow these steps:

1. **Install `http-server`**: If you don't have `http-server` installed globally, you can install it using npm:
   ```bash
   npm install -g http-server
   ```

2. **Run the server**: Navigate to the root of the project in your terminal and run the following command to start the server:
   ```bash
   http-server
   ```

3. **Access the examples**: Open your browser and navigate to [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/). You will be able to use the home page to access each of the examples via the following links:

    - [Accordions](http://localhost:8080/accordions/)
    - [Auto-Suggest](http://localhost:8080/auto-suggest/)
    - [Custom Switches](http://localhost:8080/custom-switches/)
    - [Scroll Animations](http://localhost:8080/scroll-animations/)
    - [Smooth Scrolling](http://localhost:8080/smooth-scrolling/)

Each example is designed to be fully functional in the browser, allowing you to explore and experiment with how HTML and CSS can be used to solve common UI tasks.

## How to Play Around with the Examples

To modify or experiment with the examples:

1. Navigate into the folder for the specific example (e.g., `cd accordions`).
2. Open `index.html` and `styles.css` in your code editor.
3. Make changes to the HTML or CSS and refresh your browser to see the updates live.
